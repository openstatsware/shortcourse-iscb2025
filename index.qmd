Welcome to the homepage of the short course *"Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages"*, a pre-conference course for the [46^th^ Annual Conference of the International Society for Clinical Biostatistics (ISCB)](https://iscb2025.info).
In this course you will learn hands-on skills and tools to engineer reliable R packages used in statistics.
The short course will be conducted in a full day and will be a mix of presentations and exercises.
Participants need to be comfortable with writing functions in R and use their own laptops as a prerequisite.

## Event Details

The event will be held on Sunday, 24^th^ of August 2025 as an in-person workshop at the [Biozentrum](https://www.biozentrum.unibas.ch) of the [University of Basel](https://www.unibas.ch/en), in room _Biozentrum U1.101_.
Please refer to the [conference agenda](https://www.conftool.org/iscb2025/sessions.php) for more details.

The instructors for this workshop will be Audrey T. Yeo, Alessandro Gasparini and Daniel Sabanés Bové.
You can learn more about them in the [introduction section](slides/01_intro.qmd).

```

## Prerequisites & Technical Setup

Prior to the short course, participants should

-   Set up a (free) [GitHub.com account](https://github.com/join).
    - Note: There are other git platforms like [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), but we made the choice to go with GitHub.com for the course, since it is by far the most relevant git platform in the R community.
-   Install the latest [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) software.
-   Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html) (on Windows) or the [required tools](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/) (on macOS) to compile/build packages from source code.
-   Install additional R packages using the [installation script](slides/download/install.R).

For the course, participants are required to use their own laptop to be able to participate in the exercises.

### Optional Reading List

-   Excellent and very comprehensive [R Packages (2e)](https://r-pkgs.org/)
