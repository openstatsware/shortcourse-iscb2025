Welcome to the homepage of the short course *"Good Software Engineering Practice for R Packages"*, part of ISCB 2025. In this course you will learn hands-on skills and tools to engineer reliable R packages used in statistics. The short course will be conducted in a full day and will be a mix of presentations and exercises. Participants need to be comfortable with writing functions in R and use their own laptops as a prerequisite.

## Event Details

The event will be held on TODO August 2024 as an in-person workshop at ....
Please register [here](TODO).

The presenters in this workshop will be Audrey T. Yeo, Alessandro Gasparini and Daniel Sabanés Bové.

    knitr::kable(col.names = c("", ""))
```

## Prerequisites & Technical Setup

Prior to the short course, participants should

-   Set up a (free) [GitHub.com account](https://github.com/join). 
    - Note: There are other git platforms like [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), but we made the choice to go with GitHub.com for the course, since it is by far the most relevant git platform in the R community.
-   Install the latest [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) software.
-   Install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools44/rtools.html) (only on Windows and optional if you want to try out Rcpp) 
-   Install additional R packages using the [installation script](slides/download/install.R).

For the course, participants are required to use their own laptop to be able to participate in the exercises.

### Optional reading list

-   Excellent and very comprehensive [R Packages (2e)](https://r-pkgs.org/)
-   (Hardcore) description of how [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) works
-   [GitHub 'Hello World'](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) tutorial on how to use GitHub.com (does not require git command line knowledge)
-   Tutorial on [version control with git and SVN](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) (we will be using git)
-   Command line git mini intro [trygit](https://trygit.js.org/)
-   [First steps with git & github by RStudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jN6tvgt3GK8)
-   [RStudio cheatsheets/ Git & GitHub](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/git-github.pdf)
